I'm a PhD student at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), advised by [Prof. Colleen Josephson](https://cjosephson.net/). My research interests are broadly focused on the Internet of Things (IoT), wearable sensing, and cyber-physical systems. I focus on developing novel, energy-efficient sensing techniques and end-to-end systems that address real-world challenges in healthcare, wellness, and environmental monitoring (e.g., activity recognition, posture correction, and resource tracking). My goal is to design sustainable, reliable sensing solutions that leverage non-traditional energy sources. I hold an M.S. in Mobile and IoT Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by [Prof. Quinn Jacobson](https://sv.cmu.edu/directory/faculty-and-researchers/bios/jacobson-quinn.html).
